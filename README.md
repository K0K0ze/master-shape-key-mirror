# master-shape-key-mirror
A add-on for Blender that helps with the creation of shape keys. Drivers are supported but they are still being tested.

Read the wiki: https://github.com/K0K0ze/master-shape-key-mirror/wiki 

Bug that has to be fixed:
Executing the operators is only possible in Object and Sculpt mode
